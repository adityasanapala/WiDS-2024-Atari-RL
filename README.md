# WiDS-2024: Atari Game Automation Using Reinforcement Learning (Under temporary maintenance)

Welcome! This repository contains the weekly tasks and learning material for the Reinforcement Learning project under the Winter in Data Science 2024.
This project is aimed at helping you explore and learn RL concepts and competitive programming, alongside a project if you want to explore more.

## ðŸ“Œ Weekly Plan

Each week, new tasks will be released in separate folders (`Week 2`, `Week 3`, etc.), building upon the previous work progressively.

- Weekly goals will include both coding tasks and theory concepts.
- Be sure to complete each week before the next begins, as future modules will depend on this foundation.

## ðŸ“… Week 1

We begin with foundational work: implementing basic RL environments and understanding the MDP framework to establish core concepts.

Once done, we will move through classical tabular methods: dynamic programming for exact solutions, Monte Carlo methods for sample-based learning, and temporal difference learning for online updates.

We conclude with function approximation basics to handle continuous state spaces.
